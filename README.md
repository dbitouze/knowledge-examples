# knowledge-examples

This repository contains:
 - `minimal-example`: a minimal working example of a LaTeX document written using [knowledge](https://ctan.org/pkg/knowledge);
 - `tutorial`: a tutorial for [knowledge](https://ctan.org/pkg/knowledge) and [knowledge-clustering](https://github.com/remimorvan/knowledge-clustering/).
  
**Beware**: Github's previews of `pdf` files does not support hyperlinks. It is thus
highly recommanded to download the `tutorial` (click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remimorvan/knowledge-examples/main/tutorial/kl-tutorial.pdf) to directly access the file).

Feedbacks and suggestions are most welcome, preferably in the form of
[issues](https://github.com/remimorvan/knowledge-examples/issues)
or [pull requests](https://github.com/remimorvan/knowledge-examples/pulls).
